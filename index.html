                <ul class="event">
                    <li class="event">1879: Albert Einstein was born on March 14 in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg
                        in the German Empire.</li>
                    <li class="event">1895-1900: Einstein studied physics and mathematics at the Polytechnic Institute
                        in Zurich, Switzerland.</li>
                    <li class="event">1905: This year, often referred to as Einstein's "miracle year," he published four
                        groundbreaking papers in the scientific journal Annalen der Physik. These papers introduced his
                        theory of relativity, explained the photoelectric effect (for which he later received the Nobel
                        Prize), and explored Brownian motion and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mc²).</li>
                    <li class="event">1915-1916: Einstein completed his general theory of relativity, which extended his
                        previous special theory of relativity and provided a new understanding of gravity. This theory
                        predicted the bending of light around massive objects, later confirmed by the 1919 solar eclipse
                        expedition led by Arthur Eddington.</li>
                    <li class="event">1921: Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the
                        photoelectric effect, which contributed to the development of quantum mechanics.</li>
                    <li class="event">1933: Due to the rise of the Nazi party, Einstein, who was of Jewish heritage,
                        left Germany and emigrated to the United States. He accepted a position at the Institute for
                        Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</li>
                    <li class="event">1939: Einstein signed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of the
                        potential development of atomic weapons by Nazi Germany and urging the United States to initiate
                        its own research. This letter eventually led to the establishment of the Manhattan Project.</li>
                    <li class="event">1952: Einstein was offered the presidency of the newly formed state of Israel, but
                        he declined the position.</li>
                    <li class="event">1955: Albert Einstein passed away on April 18 at the age of 76 in Princeton, New
                        Jersey.</li>
